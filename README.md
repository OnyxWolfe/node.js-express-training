# node.js-express-training
This is a project I worked on so I could learn node.js with express. I also learned about morgan, body-parser, dirname, and how to use passwords inside the file so I can lock it and only have clients I chose to see it, get into it. 

Unfortunately, with it being 90%+ only node.js and express, I cannot show the site that it was for just yet. I am working on being able to do so though. Thank yu for your paitence as I keep learning. 

I will say this. if you download this to your computer, yuo will have to use "npm init", and then import the files needed with "npm i (the file)" to be able to use it. I left the package-json in the files so you know what exactly you sould be imoprting.  

You can find the file at yor leasure by copying and pasting the following link:
